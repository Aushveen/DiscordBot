# FinalBot
This is a Discord Bot that people can use to deploy in their servers and let users play tic-tac-toe against the bot. It tracks how many times a user wins while they are
in the server through a relational database, SQLite, and I used NodeJS to develop the bot. I've also added a website feature to it using NextJS and ReactJS for the frontend,
and NodeJS for the backend that will allow the user to easily deploy the bot onto their servers.
